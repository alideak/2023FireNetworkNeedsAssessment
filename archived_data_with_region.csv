We find fuel reduction work is needed every year.  Some of Governor Newsom's/CAL FIRE's crews did work in our area several years ago, and most of that has grown back so you would not know the work was done.  The burn area where we live has many thousands, probably millions of dead standing trees left by the fire that are now dry and ready to act as kindling to kill the trees that survived the fire, but our county (irrationally) protects dead trees as if they were live trees.  Most elected officials live in urban areas and do not understand the problems caused by their regulations. They do not listen to people like me, but there is a chance they will listen to you/academics.
